I can admire the gorgeous sunsets every day, and the incredible views from the window. I love spending holidays and weekends in it with my family people. And finally I found an opportunity and got a dog, small and not exactly a pedigree. It is an eternal source of joy and positivity. A dog is that family member who loves you unconditionally no matter what. She is always waiting for me at home from my travels, and sometimes I take her with me!` }
